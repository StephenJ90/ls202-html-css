### Practice Problems: Tables

---

1. Create a table with column headings for "Product," "Quantity," and "Price." Fill the table with this data:

```plaintext
Apple, 34, $3.99/lb
Banana, 116, $1.69/lb
Carrot, 42, $2.49/lb
Kiwi, 18, $0.69 ea.
```

###### Solution:

```html
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Product</th>
      <th>Quantity</th>
      <th>Price</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Apple</td>
      <td>34</td>
      <td>$3.99/lb</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Banana</td>
      <td>116</td>
      <td>$1.69/lb</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Carrot</td>
      <td>42</td>
      <td>$2.49/lb</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Kiwi</td>
      <td>18</td>
      <td>$0.69 ea.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

---

2. Update your solution to the previous problem to make the background color of the entire table cyan.

###### Solution:

```css
table {
  background-color: cyan;
}
```

---

3. Update your solution to the previous problem to make the background color of the individual data cells orange.

###### Solution:

```css
td {
  background-color: orange;
}
```

---

4. The background color of the table in the previous problem bleeds through as a border around the data cells. Update your solution to remove that border.

###### Solution:

```css
table {
  border-collapse: collapse;
}
```

---

5. Update your solution to the previous problem to change the background color for the Banana and Kiwi rows to yellow.

###### Solution:

```css
tbody tr:nth-child(2n+1) {
  background-color: orange;
}

tbody tr:nth-child(2n+2) {
  background-color: yellow;
}
```

---

6. Create a table with both column and row headings. Use "Name," "Major," and "GPA" for the columns, and student names for the rows. Be sure to tell the browser which headings are for columns and which are for rows. 

```plaintext
Chris Lee, Supply Chain Management, 3.7
Shane Riley, Photojournalism, 3.8
Kevin Wang, Computer Science, 4.0
```

###### Solution:

```html
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Name</th>
      <th scope="col">Major</th>
      <th scope="col">GPA</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Chris Lee</th>
      <td>Supply Chain Management</td>
      <td>3.7</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Shane Riley</th>
      <td>Photojournalism</td>
      <td>3.8</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Kevin Wang</th>
      <td>Computer Science</td>
      <td>4.0</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

---

7. Without adding anything to the HTML, update the solution to the previous problem to set the column headings to green, and the row headings to blue.

###### Solution:

```css
[scope="col"] {
  color: green;
}

[scope="row"] {
  color: blue;
}
```

8. For this table, our data has categories to create subsets of data within the same table. We need "Type," "Name," and "Price" column headings. Each row represents one of three different wine types. All rows that share a wine type should use the same row heading. Your result should look like the image below.

```plaintext
Red    Meiomi Pinot Noir             $17.99
       Radius Cabernet               $9.99
       Apothic Red                   $7.97
White  Cloud Break Chardonnay        $8.99
       Kendall Jackson Chardonnay    $9.97
       Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc  $9.97
Sake   Gekkeikan Sake                $9.99
       Mura Mura Mountain Sake       $15.99
       TY KU Sake Junmai Ginjo Black $21.99
```

###### Solution:

```html
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Type</th>
      <th scope="col">Name</th>
      <th scope="col">Price</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <!-- first group of 3 rows -->
    <tr>
      <th scope="row" rowspan="3">Red</th>
      <td>Meiomi Pinot Noir</td>
      <td>$17.99</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Radius Cabernet</td>
      <td>$9.99</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Apothic Red</td>
      <td>$7.97</td>
    </tr>

    <!-- second group of 3 rows -->
    <tr>
      <th scope="row" rowspan="3">White</th>
      <td>Cloud Break Chardonnay</td>
      <td>$8.99</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Kendall Jackson Chardonnay</td>
      <td>$9.97</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc</td>
      <td>$9.97</td>
    </tr>

    <!-- third group of 3 rows -->
    <tr>
      <th scope="row" rowspan="3">Sake</th>
      <td>Gekkeikan Sake</td>
      <td>$9.99</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Mura Mura Mountain Sake</td>
      <td>$15.99</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>TY KU Sake Junmai Ginjo Black</td>
      <td>$21.99</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

9. It's difficult to tell which wines apply to each type in the output of the previous problem. Update your solution to display a 1-pixel wide gray border around all the table's cells and headings.

###### Solution:

```css
table {
  border-collapse: collapse;
}

td, th {
  border: 1px solid gray;
}
```
